# Overview
This repository focuses on executing shellcode via callback calls. In the code, we used the `EnumCalendarInfo` function, however, it is important to note that there are several other functions that can also be used for this purpose. 

# Usage 

You can run with cargo run or the compiled binary directly:
```sh
cargo run
```
```sh
target/release/shellcode_callback.exe
```
