# Overview
The technique known as "Early Bird APC Injection" is used to inject malicious code into legitimate processes of a Windows operating system. It gets the name "Early Bird" because of its distinctive feature of inserting malicious code into a process in its early stages, often before the main routines of the process have been activated.

# Usage 

You can run with cargo run or the compiled binary directly:
```sh
cargo run
```
```sh
target/release/ebapc_injection.exe
```
