# Overview

In my recent project, I tackled the technical challenge of writing and reading a shellcode into the Windows registry.
I focused on creating a shellcode that was not only functional, but also efficient and secure. To do this, I used Rust programming techniques, ensuring that the shellcode could be written to and read from the Windows registry without causing system instability or compromising security.

# Usage 

You can run with cargo run or the compiled binary directly:
```sh
cargo run
```
```sh
target/release/reg_recover-rs.exe
```
