# Overview
APC injection is an attack technique that exploits Windows' ability to schedule asynchronous procedure calls (APCs). APCs are used to execute code in a process in a specific context, usually as part of system operations. Attackers can exploit this functionality by injecting malicious code into a target process to execute their own instructions. 

# Usage 

You can run with cargo run or the compiled binary directly:
```sh
cargo run
```
```sh
target/release/apc_injection.exe
```
