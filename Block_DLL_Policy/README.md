# Overview
The "Block DLL Policy" technique is an effective strategy for preventing non-Microsoft-signed DLLs from being loaded into system processes. This policy can be applied both when creating new processes and implemented in our local process.

# Usage 

You can run with cargo run or the compiled binary directly:
```sh
cargo run
```
```sh
target/release/block_dll_policy.exe
```
