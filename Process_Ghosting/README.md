# Overview

Process Ghosting is a technique that uses a temporary file with pending deletion to create a process from that content.

# Usage 

To execute the file, pass the EXE file that will be executed:
```sh
cargo run -- <file.exe>
```
```sh
target/release/process_ghosting.exe <file.exe> <args>
```

Real use:
```sh
target/release/process_ghosting.exe mimikatz.exe "coffee localtime exit"
```
