# Overview
This repository focuses on the use of Direct / Indirect syscall using the Hells / Halos / Tartarus Gate techniques together. It currently has x64 support, but I'll make some updates to support x86.

# Usage 
The "usage" folder contains the code being used and the "syscall" folder contains the library.
