# Overview

Remote Function Stomping Injection involves temporarily replacing the implementation of a system function with a malicious version as its shellcode

# Usage 

You can run with cargo run or the compiled binary directly:
```sh
cargo run
```
```sh
target/release/rfs_injection.exe
```

# Other
- To carry out this attack you have to ensure that the target process has the DLL loaded in order for the injection to be successful.
