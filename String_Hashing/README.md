# Overview
String hashing is a technique used in malware development to transform input data (such as text strings) into a fixed-length string, known as a hash. This process is carried out to hide strings within your code.

# Usage 

You can run with cargo run or the compiled binary directly:
```sh
cargo run
```
```sh
target/release/string_hashing.exe
```
