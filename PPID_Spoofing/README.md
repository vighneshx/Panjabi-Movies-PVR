# Overview
This project focuses on PPID Spoofing, or "Parent Process ID Spoofing", an advanced security evasion technique often used by malware to hide its malicious activities. This technique involves modifying the Parent Process Identifier (PPID) of a malicious process to make it appear that it was started by a trusted or legitimate process.

# Usage 

You can run with cargo run or the compiled binary directly:
```sh
cargo run
```
```sh
target/release/ppid_spoofing.exe
```
