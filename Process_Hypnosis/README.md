# Overview

The idea behind Process Hypnosis is to develop a malicious artifact that behaves like a debugger. As a result, we gain the ability to control the execution flow of a program that is being debugged and obtain relevant information from it, such as: creation of new threads, loaded modules, exceptions and much more.

# Usage 

Run the program directly or compile and use the exe afterwards:
```sh
cargo run
```
```sh
target/release/process_hypnosis.exe
```
