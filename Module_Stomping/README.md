# Overview

The Module Stomping technique is a way of mapping or loading a DLL in your process or in another process and then retrieving the AddressOfEntryPoint address to replace it with its shellcode and execute it.

# Usage 

You can run with cargo run or the compiled binary directly:
```sh
cargo run
```
```sh
target/release/module_stomping.exe
```
